# Deliverable: Unit tests

### Instructor: Carlos Mejia
### Student: Gabriela SÃ¡nchez

Unit and integration tests are essential to prevent defects early. It is important to become familiar with quality processes and adopt it as part of our standards.

In this deliverable, only unit tests are contemplated in a specific folder (tests) following the following criteria:

1. A unit test to verify the existence of data for training.
2. Two unit tests to validate that two Custom Transformers carry out the transformations programmed in the definition of their classes.
3. A unit test to verify that the trained model exists once it is saved.

For the execution of the tests, we must place:

write in console --> !pytest test_itesm_mlops.py
